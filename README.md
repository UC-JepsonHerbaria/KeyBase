# KeyBase
Scripts and files for the Jepson eFlora Keybase Filter Keys 

 KeyBase is a dichotomous key platform hosted by Royal Botanical Gardens, Victoria, with an interface that allows one to easily navigate dichotomous keys and "filter" them with a checklist, removing key leads that do not pertain to any terminal taxa in the checklist.

The Jepson eFlora dichotomous keys are fully integrated into KeyBase, essentially making a regional flora available for any of the Jepson bioregions. Select the region in which you found your plant, and you will be taken to a simplified version of the eFlora keys in KeyBase. (e.g. Key to Plants of the Sierra Nevada, Key to Plants of the San Gabriel Mountains) Taxon names in KeyBase link back to Jepson eFlora taxon pages.
