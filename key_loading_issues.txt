Cosmos
In TJM2 they had one species (C. bipinnatus), so there was no key, and the Asteraceae key just says Cosmos.
However, there is a second species (C. sulphureus) that is a garden weed so was not in the book but is in the eFlora.
For now, we interpret "Cosmos" in the Asteraceae key as meaning "Cosmos bipinnatus"
And in the future our scientific editor needs to make a Cosmos key.

Ipomoea and other Unabridged keys
Unabridged keys such as Ipomoea, Lantana etc. did not get parsed by make_keys_for_pruning.pl
I assume either because the genus treatment starts with UNABRIDGED
or because the key itself starts with UNABRIDGED KEY
I need to update the parser to be able to handle these

Monotypic genera: need to be loaded into KB a special way

Times sign
Mentha Ã—gracilis and others: the times sign seems to mess with KB.
Perhaps replace the times sign with "X " in the filters and in the keys
But then in BYOChecklist you must depend on people entering hybrid names correctly
